# Cache-simulator
in the name of God
in each file for example random.java I put that method
each file has main method and you can run it 
in input first you should determine cache size and then enter numbers of requests and then request creat randomly .
in output you see cache state in each step and in finsh you see the hit rate

thanks a lot for iman tabrizian!
